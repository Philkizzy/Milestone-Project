Building  a Trivia Game 

We all love to answer questions! That's why I want to build a Trivia Game that has a variety of subjects
like Geography, History, Science, Cinema...

There's nothing better than learning while having fun, so let this Trivia Game gives you that.

This app will: 

1-  Ask a player to choose a name
2-  show the rules of thr game
3-  Give the possibility to start playing or exiting the game.
4-  Once the player starts to play, a timer will be running, 20 sec for each second
5-  10 questions each round.
6-  Point will be giving for each right answer.
7-  The 5 highest scores will be displaying.
8-
